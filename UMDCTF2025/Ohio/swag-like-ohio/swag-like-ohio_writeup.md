## Solution

Zooming into this panoramic photo, we see a distinct clock tower across a river bridge.
Reverse image searching, cropped in to the clock tower, reveals several locations, of which one is in Ohio, specifically Marietta.

Looking at posts from Marietta, OH that discuss the clock tower, we look at bridges around the area without trusses and land on [the Putnam Bridge.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nKborNsxTTcxrbzG7)
