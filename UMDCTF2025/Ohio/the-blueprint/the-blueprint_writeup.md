## Solution

The Blueprint could refer to several thingsâ€”potentially, Jay-Z's 2001 album "The Blueprint" or the Columbus, OH based rapper The Blueprint.

There are no distinct words or signs in this panorama, except for a "Road Closed" sign that leads to a lower path.

Contextually, this area seems to be much hillier than some parts of Ohio. Columbus is known for having little to no elevational differences, so this could be a distinct clue to the location.

Additionally, the ground foliage in the area by the homes are ones you would see around water, suggesting that our location is by a creek, lake, or pond.

Some luck may have been involved in the solution. Our team had mixed results when inputting the entire panorama into Google Image Search, with some searches choosing the autocrop the home and some choosing the crop the trees. If you're lucky, the auto-crop feature will select the green mound (and **only** the mound, almost cropped edge to edge) which will return articles about Ohio's energy-efficient mounds AND articles about the historic [Alligator Mound](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F6YJ8EfLojWCdKnw5), which is where we happen to be in this street view. 

Maybe the blue *print* refers to the alligator-shaped print on the mound.
