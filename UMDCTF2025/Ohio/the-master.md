## Solution

There is a sign on the left on the pole with "marker ahead" that shows the Ohio state shape that says "John ... Morgan" inside it. This refers to the John Hunt Morgan Heritage Trail that lists Lore City as a historical marker.

Additionally, reverse image searching the brick building on the right shows an almost 1:1 match with a wikimedia file for the United Methodist Church in Lore City, OH, located on [Main St., Lore City, OH.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X9UA6kQ74RxUCEmGA)
