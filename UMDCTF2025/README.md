## Overview by Paradigm

[UMDCTF 2025](https://umdctf.io/) was hosted by the University of Maryland and took place 04/25 - 04/27. Really fun and well-balanced for all of us participating.

This was the most brainrotten CTF we've competed in and the Brainrot UI was definitely the most unique UI we've seen for a CTF.

Our team ended up 42nd out of 702 teams! We solved 23/45 challenges from all of the various categories, listed below:

### **Crypto**  
> Challenges based on cryptographic algorithms

### **Misc**  
> The other stuff, in brainrot form

### **Nyt**  
> New York Times based puzzles utilizing a variety of exploits

### **Ohio**
> Usually categorized as OSINTâ€”in this CTF, challenges were solely on Geoguessr-type location identification. All of the challenges were based in Ohio.

### **Pwn**
> Challenges based on memory-based vulns

### **Rev**
> "Rev really pulled at my heartstrings, teased my intellectual excitement" -Stackoverflow10

### **Web**
> Challenges based on web exploits
