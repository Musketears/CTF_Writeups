# UMDCTF 2025 Writeups

UMDCTF 2025 was hosted by the University of Maryland and took place 04/25 - 04/27.

This was the most brainrotten CTF we've competed in and the Brainrot UI was definitely the most unique UI we've seen for a CTF.

Our team ended up 42nd out of 702 teams! We solved 23/45 challenges from all of the various categories, listed below:

### **Crypto**  
> Challenges based on cryptographic algorithms

### **Misc**  
> The other stuff, in brainrot form

### **Nyt**  
> New York Times based puzzles utilizing a variety of exploits

### **Ohio**

### **Pwn**
> Challenges based on memory-based vulns

### **Rev**
